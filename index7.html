	<h2 class="title">Why Winter is better than Summer</h2>


	<p>Winter is way better than Summer because you get to stay cozy inside, drink hot chocolate, go skiing and snowboarding, and the snow is very beautiful. The Summer is to hot and humid for me to enjoy.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Why Summer is better than Winter</h3>

	<p>Summer is a lot better than Winter because you get to spend more time outside in the sun, you can go to places like the beach and camping, and there is way more things to do in the Summer than there is in the winter. Winter is to gloomy and I hate the cold.</p>
